With 84 years of its long-established tradition of excellence in engineering & technology education, research and innovations, Delhi College of Engineering, (initially established with the name – Delhi Polytechnic) came into existence in the year 1941 to cater the needs of Indian industries for trained technical manpower with practical experience and sound theoretical knowledge. The institution was set up at historic Kashmere Gate campus as a follow up of the Wood and Abott Committee of 1938.It comprised of a multi-disciplinary and multi-level institution offering wide ranging programmes in engineering, technology, arts and sculpture, architecture, pharmacy and commerce. The national diploma awarded by the institution was recognized as equivalent to degree level for the purposes of employment. In 1952 the college was affiliated with University of Delhi and started formal Degree level Programmes. The department of Architecture later became the School of Planning and Architecture, now a Deemed University and Institution of National importance. The department of Arts and Sculpture became College of Arts and the departments of Chemical Technology and Textile Technology were shifted out en-block to mark beginning of the IIT Delhi at its new campus at Hauz Khas. The department of commerce was later abolished and the faculty of management studies of the University of Delhi was established by Prof. A Das Gupta, of DCE. Delhi College of Engineering is thus the mother institution of a number of national projects including IITD, SPA, College of Arts and even the famous FMS.Till 1962, the college was under the direct control of Ministry of Education, Government of India. In 1963, the administration of the college was handed over to Delhi Administration. Delhi College of Engineering was under the administrative control of Department of Technical Education & Training, Govt. of NCT of Delhi. For academic purposes, the college was affiliated to University of Delhi since 1952. From July 2009, the DCE has become Delhi Technological University vide Delhi act 6 of 2009.The erstwhile DCE has functioned from its historic Kashmere Gate Campus for almost 55 years and has shifted in 1996 to its lush green sprawling campus of 164 Acres at Bawana Road, adjoining Sector-17, Rohini, Delhi-42. Its shifting to new campus has added the dimension of research and caused innovations in plenty, which has received high national and international acclaim. As Delhi Technological University, it has the desired autonomy to excel and shape itself as a world class Technological University.Upholding and uplifting its long and remarkable history in education and research, the University currently offers various inter-disciplinary and industry relevant programs in Science, Engineering, Management & Allied areas at both the undergraduate and postgraduate level. The university currently offers 21 undergraduate, 36 postgraduate and Ph.D. programs. The ranking of DTU on national and international parameters has been continuously improving. DTU has been ranked as the 9th best institution in the India Today University rankings; as the 27th best Engineering Institution in the country and the 48th best University The h-index of Delhi Technological University is currently 121 as reported by Scopus. DTU has also performed excellently in the incubation and entrepreneurial fronts. With the efforts of ourg IIF centre, over 50 companies have been incubated at DTU this year.With 14000 students on campus, the University is proud of its world class alumni, top placement in reputable companies, growing publications and citations. Working on the principles of integrating diversification and inclusivity in education, the University has been continuously admitting international students from over 50 different countries from the last five years.   DTU will continue to uphold its golden past, and continue to deliver the best in the areas of education, research, innovation, and extension activities. With complete financial, administrative and infrastructural support for its entire fraternity, DTU will strive to add more pages in the book of its glorious history, and keep progressing forward each year by taking inspiration from its past achievements.hacklinkSakarya escortSakarya escortİzmir escortAtaşehir escortİzmir escort bayanSakarya escort bayanEscort sakaryaSakarya serdivan escortEscort bayan sakaryaSakarya bayan escortEscort hataySakarya escort numaralarıSakarya olgun escortSakarya escort fiyatsakarya hendek escortSakarya adapazarı escortBayan escort sakaryaİzmir escort bayanBetgaranti GirişSakarya escortBetpark GirişCasibomBetparkBetcioistanbul escortCasibomhttps://www.komponenelektronika.com/Betgaranti girişCasinoCasibom girişhttps://www.ilovekeisha.com/Extrabethttps://www.learntohackaccount.com/Casibom girişAliağa escortAlsancak escortBalçova escortBayindir escortBayrakli escortBergama escortBeydağ EscortBornova EscortBuca escortÇeşme escortÇiğli EscortDikili escortFoça EscortGaziemir escortGüzelbahçe EscortGrup escortKarabağlar EscortKaraburun EscortOlgun escortRus escortSınırsız escortZenci escortKarşıyaka EscortKemalpaşa EscortKiraz EscortKınık EscortKonak escortMavişehir EscortMenderes EscortMenemen EscortNarlıdere EscortÖdemiş EscortSeferihisar EscortSelçuk EscortTire EscortTorbalı EscortUcuz EscortÜçyol EscortUrla EscortCasibom twitterCasibom girişCasibomHealthizmir escort bayanCasibom girişBetparkBetparkExtrabetBetcio girişBetgaranti girişjojobet girişPusulabetjojobetPusulabetPusulabetSakarya escortSapanca escortSapanca escortvdcasino girişbetparkbetgarantiultrabet girişCasibompalacebet girişBetcio girişBetcioBetciojojobet girişjojobet giriştipobet giriştipobet giriştipobet girişEscort İzmirsakarya escortserdivan escortsapanca escortadapazarı escorthendek escortakyazı escortsakarya escortsakarya escortsakarya escortsakarya escortsakarya escortsakarya escortsakarya escortsakarya escortsakarya escortBilgi kutusuHealth And BeautyVdcasino girişSekabet girişMatbet girişSekabetBetcio girişSekabet girişSekabet güncel girişDinamobet güncel girişPalacebet güncel girişBetturkey güncel girişGrandpashabet Güncel GirişDinamobet Güncel GirişSekabetCratosroyalbetBetsatBetturkeyCasibomMarsbahisVdcasinoUltrabet  Tel: 011-27871018 | Fax:  011-27871023\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\r\\r            \\r\\r\\xa0CSS Valid  | XHTML Valid  | Top\\r             \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Last updated : 04 June 2025 15:09:52 \\r         © 2014 - 2021 , Delhi Technological University , Shahbad Daulatpur, Main Bawana Road, DL - 42, IN | ( Best viewed in 1024X768 or above ) ')]\n"
